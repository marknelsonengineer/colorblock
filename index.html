  <h1>Da Cat</h1>

  <p>Miki "Da Cat" Dora, a.k.a. Mickey Dora, a.k.a. "The Black Knight," (b. Miklos Sandor Dora 11 August 1934, Budapest,

    (1963), Surf Party (1964), Muscle Beach Party (1964), Bikini Beach (1964), Beach Blanket Bingo (1965), Ski Party
    (1965) and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965).

  <h1>Kelly Slater</h1>

  <p>Robert Kelly Slater (born February 11, 1972) is an American professional surfer known for his competitive prowess
    and style. He has been crowned ASP World Tour Champion a record 11 times, including 5 consecutive titles in 1994–98.
    He is the youngest (at age 20) and the oldest (at age 39) to win the title. Upon winning his 5th world title in
    1997, Slater passed Australian surfer Mark Richards to become the most successful champion in the history of the
    sport. In 2007 he also became the all-time leader in career event wins by winning the Boost Mobile Pro event at
    Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California. The previous record was held by Slater's childhood hero, three-time
    world champion Tom Curren.

  <p>Dorian "Doc" Paskowitz (March 3, 1921 – November 10, 2014) was an American surfer and physician, who gave up

    his family, where campers could live alongside and surf with members of the Paskowitz family.[3][4] He and his
    family have been referred to as the "First Family of Surfing".
